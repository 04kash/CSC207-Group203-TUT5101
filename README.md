# Project Description

# Project Domain
The app is designed to suggest tourist spots in a particular city to travelers along their locations pinpointed on a map. They can either 
use it to plan out the locations they want to visit beforehand to help plan out their days, or they 
could use it while in the city by entering the names or the addresses in the city. It will utilize 
an API to pinpoint these locations on an interactive map, providing the users a location 
information where each spot is located in the city.

# Key Features:
# 1) Location Pinpointing: 
Users will enter the name of the city/ locality and the app will suggest places such as hotels, restaurants, 
landmarks, etc. and use geospatial data to show the exact location of these suggested places on a map.
# 2) Interactive Map: 
This app includes an interactive map that lets users to zoom in, zoom out, and explore 
different locations in the city with map markers on certain types of locations.

# Purpose
Our purpose is to help travellers with their trip by making it easier and more efficient
to organize and commute in their chosen city with an easy-to-use tool.

# API
API we will be using: OpenTripMap API (we also plan to use GoogleMaps API to pinpoint locations on a map).
