plan out their travel itineraries beforehand, or it could also be used while in the city to locate certain
places they may wish to visit. It will utilize the OpenTripMap API to retrieve a list of locations 
within the city as well as provide a link to their exact locations on an interactive map.

landmarks, etc. and use geospatial data to show the exact location of these suggested places on a map.

This app includes a planner to which users can save their locations to. This planner can be personalized as it allows
you to choose the labels under which you would like to save your locations to.
